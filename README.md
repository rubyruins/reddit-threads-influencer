## Local installation:

### Creating the virtual environment

Create a new virtual environment to run the file using the following command:

`python3 -m venv <name of the environment>`

### Activating the environment

We will now activate the environment using:

`source <name>/bin/activate`

Note: when activated, the name of the environment appears in the parenthesis before username (or some other form.)

### Installing packages on the virtual environment

As long as the environment is active, pip will install packages in the currently active virtual environment. Navigate to the right directory containing the requirements file to install the dependencies using:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Deactivating the environment

To deactivate the environment just type:

`deactivate`

### Adding the virtual environment to JuPyter notebook
`
Run the following when the environment is activated:

`python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=<name>`

where <name> is the name of the environment.

When you open the Jupyter notebook, you should be able to select the environment.

### Removing the environment

To remove the virtual environment from JuPyter notebook, just run

`jupyter-kernelspec uninstall <name>`
